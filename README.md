# MPPT Solar Battery Charge Controller
Battery charger controller using Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)

## Introduction
In order to supply the increasing energy demand, Solar Energy can be utilized.​ ​<br>

In order to make use of solar energy to power DC loads and to store energy, a solar charge controller is needed.​ ​<br>

We need a solar charge controller to,
<ul>
  <li>Monitor the state of the charge of the battery.​</li>
  <li>Protect the battery from overcharging.</li>
  <li>Protect the battery from full discharge.​</li>
</ul>

This monitoring and permanent protection system helps to extend the performance and life of the batteries.​ ​<br>

This charger controller, includes the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method to extract the maximum power from the solar panel.​
