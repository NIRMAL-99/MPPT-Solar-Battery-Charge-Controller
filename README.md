# MPPT Solar Battery Charge Controller
Battery charger controller using Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)

## Introduction
In order to supply the increasing energy demand, Solar Energy can be utilized.​ ​<br>
In order to make use of solar energy to power DC loads and to store energy, a solar charge controller is needed.​ ​<br>

We need a solar charge controller to,​ ​<br>
Monitor the state of the charge of the battery.​ ​<br>
Protect the battery from overcharging.​ ​<br>
Protect the battery from full discharge.​ ​<br>

This monitoring and permanent protection system helps to extend the performance and life of the batteries.​ ​<br>

This charger controller, includes the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method to extract the maximum power from the solar panel.​
